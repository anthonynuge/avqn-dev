        <p>
          Hello my name is Anthony graduate passionate about building cool
          things that make a difference. I love diving into challenging
          problems, whether it's crafting efficient algorithms, designing
          eye-catching user interfaces, or creating seamless animations. My work
          is all about blending creativity and technology to deliver valuable,
          aesthetically pleasing experiences. Outside of coding, you'll probably
          find me reading, gaming, watching anime, or playing pickleball. I
          thrive in collaborative environments where everyone is passionate, and
          I'm always looking to learn from those around me. I'm especially
          excited about exploring AI, machine learning, and cryptocurrency
          development. Right now, I'm focused on expanding my skills and working
          with cutting-edge technology, especially in environments that push me
          to grow both personally and professionally. Let's build something
          amazing together!
